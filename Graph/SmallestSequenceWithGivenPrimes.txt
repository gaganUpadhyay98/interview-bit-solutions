/*
Given three prime number(p1, p2, p3) and an integer k. Find the first(smallest) k integers which have only p1, p2, p3 or a combination of them as their prime factors.

Example:

Input : 
Prime numbers : [2,3,5] 
k : 5

If primes are given as p1=2, p2=3 and p3=5 and k is given as 5, then the sequence of first 5 integers will be: 

Output: 
{2,3,4,5,6}

Explanation : 
4 = p1 * p1 ( 2 * 2 )
6 = p1 * p2 ( 2 * 3 )

Note: The sequence should be sorted in ascending order
